<h1>Program to create Pages for a Personalized Photo Calendar</h1>
<p>
I like personalized photo calendars with my own pictures and my own events.
They are also a good gift for parents and grandparents.
You need 13 images: one for every month and one for the title page.
This program supports you in two ways to generate the corresponding pages.
<ul>
<li>You define your own events such as birthdays, wedding anniversaries, regional holidays, school holidays, events of your sports club or similar once in the program.
    They are then automatically added to the calendar every year.</li>
<li>Your pictures will be fitted into the calendar page. They can be rotated if necessary. Multiple pictures can be arranged automatically.</li>
</ul>

At the end you will send these 13 pages to a company like
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.whitewall.com/de/fotokalender-erstellen" target="_blank">WHITE WALL</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.orwo.de/detail/277/fotokalender/wandkalender-selbst-gestalten" target="_blank">ORWO</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.myposter.de/fotokalender" target="_blank">MYPOSTER</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.posterxxl.de/fotokalender/wandkalender" target="_blank">posterXXL</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.fotoservice-mms.de/fotokalender.html" target="_blank">MediaMarkt / SATURN</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.photobox.co.uk/shop/calendars-and-diaries" target="_blank">Photobox</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=photo+calendar+creator" target="_blank">and many others &hellip;</a> </li>
</ul>
I already tried the first 5 companies myself and was satisfied. However, I cannot take responsibility for these companies. I do not have an agreement with any of them.

<h2>Usage</h2>
I use the IDE <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. 
To edit and run the photo calendar there, you have to open the following three project files:
<ul>
<li><code>DreiRoedersUtil/.project</code></li>
<li><code>Painter/.project</code></li>
<li><code>PhotoCalendar/.project</code></li>
</ul>
To generate suitable pages, you must adapt the program accordingly:

<h3>Set Year and Start Month</h3>
The starting year and month will be set in the file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/FotoKalenderOpt.java</code>:
<br/><code>de.dreiroeders.fotokalender.FotoKalenderOpt. YEAR1</code> and in
<br/><code>de.dreiroeders.fotokalender.FotoKalenderOpt. MONTH1</code>.
<br/>
A calendar consists of 13 pages. 
Usually, the months January to December and a title page.
However, I like to start calendars in July or August when the appointments of my Bundesliga club are published.
Then I use the title page as a normal calendar page and thus have 13 months.
Everyone can adapt this to suit themselves.

<h3>Your Own Events</h3>
Your own events will be set in the file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/PhotoKalender.java</code>
in the method <code>addDates()</code>.
I have so many dates that I distributed the dates across several subroutines.
These subroutines are usually defined in the file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/FotoKalender.java</code>.
They can be found quickly using the usual commands in the development environment.
It is best to follow these examples and then set your own dates.
If you don't want private dates, you can of course remove all calls.

<h3>Yout Own Pictures</h3>
Your own images will be set in the file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/PhotoKalender.java</code>
in the method <code>makeFamilyCal(FotoKalenderOpt trgOpt)</code>.
It is best to use the examples as a guide.
If one or more images are to be distributed evenly on a page, then <code>Calendar.FEBRUARY</code> is a good example.
The images are distributed evenly on a page.
Since the images usually do not fit exactly into the free fields, something is cut off on the left and right or top and bottom so that the images fit exactly on the page.
<br/>
To position the images precisely, <code>Calendar.JUNE</code> is a good example.

<h3>Completion</h3>
Once a few pages are finished, you can look at the result. 
To do this, you start <code>main(String[] args)</code> in the file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/FotoKalenderOpt.java</code>.
Then you will find the generated image files in the <code>Results</code> folder.
You will send these images to the selected company via the Internet so that they can print the final calendar.
<br/>
If you find that the dimensions of your own image files do not match the company's desired dimensions,
adjust the static variable <code>CalendarSheet.fWeight</code> accordingly and rerun <code>main(String[] args)</code>.
The file <code>PhotoCalendar/src/de/dreiroeders/fotokalender/FotoKalenderOpt.java</code> is ideal for this.
This variable defines the ratio of length to width of the calendar sheets generated.
